## My Personal Website

[My personal website](http://www.bjones.cloud) is a simple HTML/CSS webpage used to display a few things including my certifications, github portfolio, and an AWS database I'm currently working on with fantasy sports projections. It is hosted on AWS using S3, Route 53, and will be updated using AWS CodeBuild/CodePipeline.

I will be adding other repositories that include the code for CB/CP and the CloudFormation template I use for disaster recovery.
